### Description
You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:


	
	The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).
	
	
	The digit product of n (the product of its digits).
	


Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: n = 99

Output: true

Explanation:

Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.


Example 2:


Input: n = 23

Output: false

Explanation:

Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 106
